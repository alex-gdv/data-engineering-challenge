# Data Engineering Challenge

In this project, I worked on three different tasks:

1) preprocessing semi-structured data;
2) designing an automated system to fetch data via HTTP requests and evaluating its potential advantages and disadvantages; and
3) creating a web application to deliver the fetched and processed data.

I used pandas and regular expressions to process the semi-structured data. I created a diagram for a system deployed on AWS and evaluated its advantages and disadvantages. Finally, I used Flask to create a web app and Docker to containerise it.
